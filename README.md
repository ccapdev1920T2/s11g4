# Recipy (S11g4)
Recipy is a website wherein users can share recipes, save recipes and other users. Complete features of the application can be found in the project specification **Group 4 S11 MP Specification.pdf**

### Getting Started
1. Make sure to have Node.js installed  
1. Clone/ Download the repository and extract the zip file  
1. Make sure to install the npm modules with `npm install`
1. Set up the Node.js server with `node index.js` or `npm start`
1. Access the application through `localhost:3000` in Google Chrome  

### Running Tests
* Upon accessing the application, the user may opt to register, log in, or simply browse through the different recipes  
* When registering, simply fill up the form  
* When logging in, the user may opt to use the following premade accounts:  

| Username | Password |
|:---:|:---:|
|sampaulino23|pass123|
|giantiyan|pass123|
|shimeizhang08|pass123|
|arrenantioquia|pass123|
|yohancai|pass123|

* If the user opts not to log in nor register, he/she can still browse through recipes. However, the user would have limited features such as he/she cannot comment on recipes, upvote on recipes, and add recipes/users to his/her favorites  
* Users who have logged in can create recipes, comment (and delete their comment) on recipes, upvote on recipes, add recipes/users to favorites, and the likes  
* The owner of a recipe can delete the comments of other users in his/her own recipe post. However, only the owner of the comments can edit their own comment

### Important Notes
* Be patient as there are some pages in the site that load slower than others, ie. recipes page  
* Wait for the page to refresh when upvoting, deleting comments and recipes, adding comments, editing comments, and the likes
